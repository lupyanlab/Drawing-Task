I do frequently.
I do automatically.
I do without having to consciously remember.
that makes me feel weird if I do not do it.
I do without thinking.
that would require effort not to do.
that belongs to my daily routine.
I do not need to think about doing.
that is typically "me."
I have been doing for a long time.
